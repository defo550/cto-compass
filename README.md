# CTO Compass ðŸ§­

Navigate the complexities of technology leadership with the Strategy, Execution, and Culture (SEC) Framework.

A practical guide for CTOs, aspiring technology leaders, and "accidental CTOs" who need structure in balancing Strategy, Execution, and Culture.

## Purpose

This framework emerged from real-world experience leading technology at a healthcare analytics startup. It provides:

- **Clear structure** for the often ambiguous CTO role
- **Time allocation guidance** to balance competing priorities
- **Practical tagging system** for tracking where your time actually goes
- **Career development roadmap** for aspiring technology leaders

## The SEC Framework

The CTO Compass organizes technology leadership into three essential domains:

### Strategy (25-35% of time)

#### Setting direction and external positioning

- Technology Planning
- Market Positioning
- Partnership Strategy
- Stakeholder Management

### Execution (50-60% of time)

#### Delivering results and operational excellence

- Data & Infrastructure
- Security & Compliance
- Product & Engineering Delivery
- Business Operations

### Culture (15-25% of time)

#### Building teams and organizational capability

- Team Development
- Personal Development

## Quick Start

1. **Explore the Mindmap**: View the [SEC Framework visualization](mindmap.mermaid)
2. **Understand the Framework**: Read the [complete guide](docs/framework.md)
3. **Apply to Your Role**: Check out [real-world examples](docs/examples.md)
4. **Track Your Time**: Use the tagging system to optimize your effectiveness

## Time Allocation by Company Stage

| Company Size   | Strategy | Execution | Culture |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- |
| Small (10-25)  | 25-35%   | 50-60%    | 15-25%  |
| Growth (25-75) | 30-40%   | 40-50%    | 20-30%  |
| Scale (75+)    | 35-45%   | 35-45%    | 20-30%  |

## Who This Is For

- **New CTOs** struggling with role definition and time management
- **Aspiring CTOs** preparing for technology leadership
- **Technical Founders** wearing multiple hats (CTO/CIO/CISO)
- **VP Engineers** transitioning to executive roles
- **Technology Leaders** seeking structure and benchmarks

## Background

This framework was developed through real experience as a co-founder and CTO of a healthcare technology company. It addresses the common challenge of the "accidental CTO" - technical professionals thrust into leadership without formal training or clear role definition.

The SEC Framework provides the structure I wish I'd had when first stepping into technology leadership.
