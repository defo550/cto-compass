# CTO Compass Implementation Guide

A practical roadmap for implementing the SEC Framework in your technology leadership role.

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for adopting the SEC Framework, whether you're a new CTO finding your footing or an experienced leader optimizing your effectiveness.

## Career Development Applications

**Skill Gap Identification**: Use framework to identify underdeveloped areas:

- _Low Strategy allocation_: May need to develop market positioning and partnership skills
- _High Execution, low Culture_: Time to focus on team development and personal growth
- _Imbalanced domains_: Signals need for delegation or role clarification

**Interview Preparation**: Framework provides comprehensive structure for discussing CTO responsibilities with hiring managers, investors, or board members.

**Performance Evaluation**: Systematic approach to demonstrating comprehensive role coverage and value creation across all technology leadership dimensions.

**Mentorship Discussions**: Structured framework for conversations with senior technology executives about role development and career progression.
