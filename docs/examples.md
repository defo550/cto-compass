## Time Allocation Benchmarks

### Small Company CTO (10-25 employees)

**Recommended Distribution:**

- Strategy: 25-35%
- Execution: 50-60%
- Culture: 15-25%

**Rationale**: Higher execution demands due to hands-on technical work and limited delegation options

### Growth Stage CTO (25-75 employees)

**Recommended Distribution:**

- Strategy: 30-40%
- Execution: 40-50%
- Culture: 20-30%

**Rationale**: Balanced approach as delegation increases and strategic work becomes more critical

### CTO/CIO/CISO Combined Role

**Additional Considerations:**

- Security & Compliance should represent 15-25% of total Execution time
- Personal Development minimum 7-12% to avoid skill obsolescence
- Team Development increases as team grows (5% per additional 10 employees)
