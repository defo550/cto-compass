# CTO Compass Quick Start Guide

Get oriented with the S.E.C. Framework in 15 minutes.

## 📍 Step 1: Understand Your Current Position (5 min)

Take a moment to reflect on yesterday. What did you actually do?

- **Strategy work?** (Planning, partnerships, stakeholder meetings)
- **Execution work?** (Coding, infrastructure, security, delivery)
- **Culture work?** (Hiring, mentoring, team meetings, learning)

Write down your rough percentages: S: xx%r E: xx%, C: xx%

## 🧭 Step 2: Review the Framework (5 min)

The S.E.C. Framework provides structure for the CTO role:

### Strategy - "Where are we going?"

- Technology Planning → Roadmaps and technical direction
- Market Positioning → Competitive advantage through tech
- Partnership Strategy → Strategic relationships
- Stakeholder Management → CEO, board, investor alignment

### Execution - "How do we get there?"

- Data & Infrastructure → Technical foundations
- Security & Compliance → Risk and regulatory management
- Product & Engineering Delivery → Shipping quality software
- Business Operations → Revenue and scaling support

### Culture - "Who's coming with us?"

- Team Development → Building technical capability
- Personal Development → Your own growth

## 🏃 Step 3: Start Tagging (5 min)

Try tagging your current week's tasks:

```text
Monday:
- Team standup → Culture.Team Development.Team rituals and practices
- AWS cost optimization → Execution.Data & Infrastructure.Infrastructure scalability
- Quarterly planning with CEO → Strategy.Technology Planning.OKR management

Tuesday:
- Interview senior engineer → Culture.Team Development.Talent acquisition
- Security audit review → Execution.Security & Compliance.Risk assessment
- Board deck preparation → Strategy.Stakeholder Management.Board communications
```

## 📊 Your Target Allocation

Based on your company size:

| Your Company Size | Strategy Target | Execution Target | Culture Target |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| 10-25 people      | 25-35%          | 50-60%           | 15-25%         |
| 25-75 people      | 30-40%          | 40-50%           | 20-30%         |
